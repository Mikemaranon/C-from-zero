# C from Zero

This repository will show all my progress learning C from the basics, hoping to jump to C++ in the future after understanding the most important characteristics of this programming language.
In this readme i will be inclulding a general index of everything.

## 1. Introduction and Fundamentals
We will be starting with the essentials of C: Variables, Arrays, operators, etc.Later on we will dive into conditional operators and loops

## 2. Functions and Memory Management
After learning how the basics of any programing language works, we will see the structure of a C program learning functions and the way it manages its code optimizing the reuse of lines by the use of functions. After that we will see why in order to optimize the performance of any program, the most important element is the memory. We need to know how it works in order to better boost it and get better and faster results

## 3. File reading and writing 
In this section, I will cover the basics of file input and output operations in C. This includes reading from and writing to files using standard C library functions.

## 4. Strucures: The father of Objects
Finally, we will explore the concept of structures in C, which are a fundamental way to group related data together. Structures allow us to create complex data types that can represent real-world entities more accurately. This section will cover how to define and use structures, including nested structures, and how they serve as a foundation for object-oriented programming concepts in languages like C++.
