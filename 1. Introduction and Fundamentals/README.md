# Module 1: Introduction to C

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to the C programming language. It covers the fundamental concepts and constructs that are essential for writing basic C programs. The module is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the language, including variables, arrays, conditionals, and looping systems. By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of the basic building blocks of C programming and be able to write simple programs.

## 1.1. Variables and Arrays
This section introduces the basic building blocks of C programming: `variables and arrays`. Variables are used to store data, and arrays are used to store collections of data.

### Variables
Variables are named storage locations in memory that hold a value. They can be of different types such as `int`, `float`, `char`, etc. This subsection covers how to declare, initialize, and use variables in C.

### Arrays
Arrays are `collections of elements` of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. This subsection explains how to declare, initialize, and access arrays in C.

## 1.2. Conditionals
This section covers conditional statements, which allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions.

### If-else
The `if-else` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is `true`, and another block of code if the condition is `false`. This subsection explains the syntax and usage of `if-else` statements.

### switch
The `switch` statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a `case`, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case. This subsection covers the syntax and usage of switch statements.

## 1.3. Looping systems
This section introduces loops, which are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

### while
The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is `true`. This subsection explains the syntax and usage of `while` loops.

### do-while
The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once before the condition is tested. This subsection covers the syntax and usage of `do-while` loops.

### for
The `for` loop is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It is typically used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. This subsection explains the syntax and usage of `for` loops.
