# C, a high-level programming language

Yes, even though it might sound strange, C is a high level programing language. Most people consider it a low level one because of its complexity compared to other languages such us Python or JavaScript. This is not only incorrect, but we can even cosider C the father of the most popular high level languages

To start this module, we will be introducing the fundamentals of any typed programming language: the variables and their different types. First of all, we can consider a variable like a small box. in this box we will store some information that we have the intention to use in the future. 

Lets say we want to store a integer number such as 1 or 7, for this, we will use the type `int`.
``` C
int number = 2;
```
If we wanted to store a decimal number, the situation would change. int would no longer be useful, and we would need to use the variables `float` or `double`.
``` C
int number = 2.5;       // error
double number = 2.5;
float number = 2.5;
```
